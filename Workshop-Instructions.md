# Create an Issue

Let's create a tracking Issue to record our first item of work, which will be to create a file with your name.

1. In the repository's **Issues** tab, click **New issue**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.002.jpeg)
1. Enter a **Title** indicating you will create a file with your name on it [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.003.jpeg). Example:
    ```
    Create a new file - John
    ```
1. In the **Body** of the Issue, let's add a _Description_ similar to the following [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.003.jpeg):
    ```
    I need to create a new file with my name.
    ```
1. Click **Submit new issue**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.003.jpeg)

# Add your file and create Pull Request

Let's propose a file change to the repository to create a Pull Request:

1. In the repository's **Code** tab, navigate to the `workshop-attendees` folder. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.006.jpeg)
1. While in the `workshop-attendees` folder, click **Create new file**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.007.jpeg)

# Now, a pipeline

GitHub concepts are well documented features, but I believe it is important to understand how developers do their work. Even new users to GitHub can set up a CI/CD development pipeline with little effort, let's give it a try now.

To practice creating a pipeline, let's set up our own personal workspace. To create our workspace we will [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [github-for-managers](https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers) repository. A **fork** is effectively a copy of a project you can use to freely experiment without affecting the original project.

1. Navigate to the workshop repository at https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers.
1. In the top-right-hand corner, click **Fork** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.017.jpeg). If asked, fork to your personal GitHub account.
1. You will then be taken to your forked repository where you can experiment. Notice the `forked from...` message in the top-left, and notice you can now see a **Settings** tab because you are the admin here. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.018.jpeg)
1. Let's protect the master branch. Click the repository's **Settings** tab, then **Branches**. Under **Protected branches** click the dropdown and select `master`. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.019.jpeg)
1. In the **Branch protection for `master`** page, check all available settings. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.020.jpeg)

# Setup CI

- **Definition:** [Continuous Integration](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)

Let's set up a CI job for your repository. This will give us an automated build and test step when we propose a change.

1. <a href="https://www.circleci.com" target="\_blank">Open a new tab</a>, go to https://circleci.com and click **Log In**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.022.jpeg)
1. Click **Sign in with GitHub** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.023.jpeg), and then click **Authorize circleci** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.024.jpeg).
1. After authorization, you can access the CircleCI app at https://circleci.com/dashboard.
    - **Note:** If you are already a member of multiple GitHub orgs, you need to select your username in the dropdown at the top of the page. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.025.jpeg)
1. On the left side, click **Projects** and then click **Add Project**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.026.jpeg)
1. Next to **github-for-managers**, click **Setup project** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.027.jpeg), then:
    - For **Operating System**, select **Linux** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.028.jpeg)
    - For **Platform**, select **1.0** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.028.jpeg)
    - Click **Start building** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.028.jpeg)
1. After up to four minutes, your CircleCI tests should pass :tada: :tada:. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.029.jpeg)
1. Check out the new Webhook created in your GitHub repository. Go to the repository's **Settings** tab, then select **Webhooks** to see that it was automatically created when you authorized it. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.030.jpeg)

**Post-workshop exercise:** Try setting up a Travis CI status check on your forked repository at https://travis-ci.org.

# Setup CD

- **Definition:** [Continuous Delivery](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-delivery)

So our tests are wired in with CircleCI, now how do you deploy before merge? This helps us perform a better code review, we can see our actual application deployment before merging to `master`. Let's try it out!

First, let's connect [Heroku to GitHub](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration):

1. <a href="https://www.heroku.com" target="\_blank">Open a new tab</a>, go to the Heroku dashboard at https://dashboard.heroku.com and Log In. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.032.jpeg) [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.033.jpeg)
    - If you haven't yet, register for a new Heroku account. You will be sent a confirmation email. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.034.jpeg)
1. Click **New > Create new app**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.035.jpeg)
1. For the **App name**, enter `my-awesome-book-app-GITHUB_USERNAME`. Heroku app names must be unique so append `-GITHUB_USERNAME` to the name. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.036.jpeg)
1. Click **Add to pipeline**, then select **Create new pipeline**. Leave the defaults and click **Create app**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.036.jpeg)
1. In the Heroku **Deploy** tab, for the **Deployment method** select :octocat: **GitHub** and **Connect to GitHub**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.037.jpeg) Log in if prompted, but it should take your already logged-in session, where you can click **Authorize heroku**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.038.jpeg)
1. After authenticating Heroku to GitHub, type `github-for-managers` in the text box and click **Search**. Our repository should be displayed, then click **Connect**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.039.jpeg)

Now, let's enable [Heroku Review Apps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps). When a Pull Request is opened, each new commit can trigger automatic test deployments in an isolated environment, called Review Apps in Heroku:

1. Go to the Heroku dashboard at https://dashboard.heroku.com. Select **my-awesome-book-app-GITHUB_USERNAME**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.040.jpeg)
1. Click **Enable Review Apps** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.041.jpeg), then select both options:
    - :ballot_box_with_check: _Select Create new review apps for new pull requests automatically_ [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.042.jpeg)
    - :ballot_box_with_check: _Select Destroy stale review apps automatically_ [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.042.jpeg)
    - Click **Enable** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.042.jpeg)

# End-to-End Test

Now we have CI/CD setup for our app. Let's try it out!

1. Navigate back to your GitHub repository **fork** and select the **Code** tab. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.044.jpeg)
1. Go to the file `app/models/book.rb` and click the :pencil2: pencil icon to edit it. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.044.jpeg) [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.045.jpeg)
1. On Line 3, uncomment the line by deleting the `#` character at the beginning. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.046.jpeg) [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.047.jpeg)
1. Scroll down to the **Commit changes** section. Add a commit message, using the following as an example: [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.048.jpeg)
    ```
    Adding new test for the app
    ```
1. In the **Create a new branch...** option, enter a new branch name, using the following as an example: [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.048.jpeg)
    ```
    add-test
    ```
1. Click **Commit changes** [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.048.jpeg). A [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) will automatically be opened for this proposed change.
1. Add the `enhancement` label and click **Create pull request**. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.049.jpeg)
1. The Pull Request will now show the creation of a conversation about the change as well as the integrated dev tools you can follow throughout the requested change. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.050.jpeg)
    - Code Owner enforcement with automatic Code Review
    - Conversation
    - Initial and subsequent commits to this branch
    - Automatic build/test with link
    - Automatic staging deployment with link
1. Browse the links in the Pull Request to see additional detail about your change and the checks it triggers.
    - One of the deployment links in the thread will link to an actual deployment of the `MyAwesomeBookApp` application. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.050.jpeg) [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.051.jpeg)
    - Another link to show you the status of the CircleCI build/testing. [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.050.jpeg) [:camera:](workshop-images/github-for-managers.052.jpeg)
